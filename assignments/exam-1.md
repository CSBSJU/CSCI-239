### Logic
* Propositions and logical operations
  * propositions
    * distinguish propositions from other types of statements
  * truth values (T, F)
  * compound statements
  * logical operations
    * conjunction &and;
    * disjunction
      * inclusive or &or;
      * exclusive or &oplus;
    * negation &not;
    * conditional operation p &rarr; q
    * biconditional operation p &harr; q
  * truth tables
  * convert between logic and English
* Evaluating compound propositions
  * order of operations
  * determine the truth value of a proposition
* Conditional statements
  * hypothesis
  * conclusion
  * contrapositive
  * inverse
* Logical equivalence
  * tautologies
  * contradictions
  * prove two things are logically equivalent
* Laws of proposition
  * be able to apply the laws to restate propositions
* Predicates and quantifiers
  * predicates
  * domains
  * quantifiers
    * universal &forall;
    * existential &exist;
  * quantified statements
    * free and bound variables
    * determining if a quantified statement is a proposition
    * understanding the meaning of a quantified statement
    * convert between logic and English
  * proving universal and existentially quantified statements
    * counterexamples
  * nested quantifiers
* Logical reasoning
  * arguments
    * hypotheses
    * conclusions
    * convert between logic and English
  * determining if an argument is valid or invalid
    * using a truth table
    * use the rules of inference

### Proofs
* Theorems
