## Objectives

* to become acquainted with the ghci Haskell environment
* to learn to use built-in Haskell programs
* to write a few simple Haskell programs

## Preliminaries

If you have not already done so, make a `CS239` directory in your Linux home
directory. Copy the directory
`/usr/people/classes/CS239/labs/IntroductionToHaskell` into your `CS239`
directory. Open a terminal window, and type `ghci` at the command prompt. You
should see something like the following:

```
GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
Loading package base ... linking ... done.
Prelude>
```

Complete the [pre-lab]() exercise for this lab before continuing below. If you
have not already done so, open the file `SampleCode.lhs` in a text editor such
as gedit, and run ghci in a terminal, changing to the `IntroductionToHaskell`
directory if necessary.

## Part 1: Using the *ghci* program

Type `:?` at the *ghci* prompt. You get a list of the *ghci* system commands,
all of which start with the `:` character. We will mostly be interested in the
first group, the commands available from the prompt.

Now let's try a few things. If we type something at the prompt that doesn't
start with `:`, the program tries to interpret it as Haskell code. Try entering
`5`.

You should get `5` back because `5` means 5 in Haskell. Now enter `5*5`. Do you
get what you expect? You should get `25` since `5*5` means 5 multiplied by 5 in
Haskell. Try entering a few more simple arithmetic expressions using both
integer and floating-point numbers. Note cases where the result is different
than you expect. How do you do integer division?

## Part 2: Using simple Haskell programs in *ghci*

Now let's see how we can develop programs in Haskell. Use the `:cd` command at
the *ghci* prompt to change into your `CS239/IntroductionToHaskell` directory.
(If you were already in this directory when you ran *ghci*, you can skip this
command.) The directory should contain the file `SampleCode.lhs`. You can verify
this by using the `:!` command to run the shell command `ls` thus: `:! ls`.
Similarly, `:! pwd` will tell you what directory youâ€™r currently in.

Open the file `SampleCode.lhs` in a text editor such as *gedit* so you can view
the Haskell code. Next, load the file into *ghci* using the command `:load
Lab01.SampleCode.lhs`.

You should see a couple of lines of compiler messages followed by a new *ghci*
prompt: `*Main>`.

Notice that the file contains the definition of several Haskell functions. Try
the following commands to test one of these functions:

```
square 5
square 4.32
square -4.6
square (-4.6)
```

Why did `square -4.6` fail and `square (-4.6)` succeed?

Try the `double`, `max2a`, `max2b`, and `lcd` functions with various choices of
parameters. Based on what you learned using the square function, how should you
handle negative parameters with these other functions? Does the `lcd` function
work correctly for negative numbers? If not, any ideas on how to correct it?

## Part 3: Writing simple Haskell programs in *ghci*

Write a function called `fourth` that computes the fourth power of its argument
by calling `square` twice. Put the function in the same file with the sample
programs, and be sure to add comments as to what it does and that you are the
author of the function. Use the `:reload` command to compile and load your
changes into *ghci*. There are at least two different ways to do this, but note
that it may be necessary to use parentheses to make it work. Test your function
on both integer and floating-point arguments.

Write a function called `eighth` that computes the eighth power of its argument
by calling some combination of `square` and/or `fourth`. Again, there are
multiple ways to do this, and again, test your function on several arguments.

To exit from *ghci* type `:quit` at the prompt.

Be prepared to show your pre-lab work at the beginning of lab.
